                    Hi, I am Nick! I am a coding developer from Seattle with a love for sports, the outdoors, and video games.

            <h2>Education History</h2>

            <h2>Job Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    My background is in Real Estate Acquistions - primarily in commercial real estate. I have acquired NNN properties consisting of single standing retail stores across the country for a private equity firm. I specialize in sourcing, negotiating, and closing deals on an all cash basis. I also source and have required residential homes through the means of foreclosure to ultimately produce income producing properties.
